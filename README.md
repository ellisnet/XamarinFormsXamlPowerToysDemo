# Xamarin Forms XAML Power Toys Demo Project

## Updates
10/18/2016 - Updated BindablePicker to latest version.

## Introduction
This is the solution that I used to record the XAML Power Toys videos.
  
After downloading or cloning, you MUST right-click the solution and select "Restore NuGet Packages."

After restoring, I always restart Visual Studio.  I know you shouldn't have to do this, but I found it cover 95% of my headaches.

Enjoy,
